### Seeing the Welcome to TDS video screen - want access to carPlay

If you are seeing the screen talking about the web view feature and you want the carplay features you can access this quickly, This screen is so that Apple and others who might download the app do not see and understand how it works. 

1. Press on "Enter Code"

2. Type in the code "CarPlay"

3. Now reload the app, eg: close from app switcher and open again, you should only have to do this once.

Any issues please reach out. 


## Wheres the code?
Right now the code is not open for everyone to download, I don't want apple to patch my app out of the system, however i want to allow people to use it and make use of it, so i will be updating the testflight often


I am pleased to say the code has now been added for you all to use, see bellow about use.
